# Multipond
Connecting multiple, non-dendritic ponds using culverts

The ultimate goal of this project is to model the hydraulic relationship between multiple ponds connected with culverts. The program will calculate inflow totals using hydrographs exported from HEC-HMS and use Federal Highway Authority HDS-5, 3rd Edition methodology to calculate the flow through connecting culverts. A user supplied table will be used for outflow structures. Most software of this nature forces the system to be dendritic (i.e., higher ponds flow to lower ponds without backflow or changes in tailwater condition). This program will overcome that limitation, allowing for solutions in flat terrain where comparative pressure head, rather than gravity, is the controlling factor in flow change.

This project is not even close to functional. In addition to the above, it is also an attempt by a classically trained engineer to move from simple scripting to developing more robust, object-oriented software. He hopes to have a working product early in 2019.
